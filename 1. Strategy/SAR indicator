SAR indicator is an alternative buy/sell indicator.
It performs best when the market is not a choppy market.
The buy/sell signals generated by SAR are usually earlier than MACD, therefore, may perform better (need to be tested).
SAR indicator should be used with the association of long period (60 or 120 day? need to be tested) Moving Average (MA). The buu-in signal (dot) of SAR should be lower than the MA value.
