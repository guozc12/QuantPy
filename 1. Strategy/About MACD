Candle plot data like day K is used to generate Expotential Moving Average (EMA). 
Short period (within 1 day): 1min k, 3min k, 5min k, 15min k
Medium period (>1 day, <5-10 day): 30min k, 60min k, 120min k, 4h k
Medium-long period (>10 day, <30 day): day k
Long period: week k, month k

Day trading:
5min k performs the best in day trading
15min k indicates day-time bullish or bearish cycles

Medium period trading: 
120 k performs the best in indicating medium-period cycles
Day k performs well in indicating bullish or bearish cycles within a year

MACD strategies:
1. In most cases, golden crossing is accurate in indicating the buy time.
2. In most cases, dead crossing would be later than the best selling time.
3. To determine the best selling time, we can try two strategies: 
   3.1 Selling at the peak of the DIF line, or the time when MACD value is the largest/strarts to reduce; drawback: MACD value may keep positive and (probable) rise again.
   3.2 Selling at the dead crossing of shorter-period MACD (e.g. for 120k MACD, use the dead crossing of 60k MACD to determine selling point); drawback: two times of data amount required.

4. The trend in a shorter-period MACD must be within the trend in a longer-perid MACD. It means that longer-period MACD can predict longer momentum, trading decisions in shorter-period MACD should consider longer-period MACD trends.
   Long up, short down: good for buying (following)
   Long up, short up: time scope for a good selling
   Long down, short down: perfect for buying if both have golden crossing; otherwise, may buy the short uptrend (risky).
   Long down, short up: No action is needed. Not a good time for buying/selling.
