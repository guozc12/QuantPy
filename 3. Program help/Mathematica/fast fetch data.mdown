# about using mathematica fetch financial data faster
* As we mentioned before, directly using mma to fetch stock data is very slow, even with network with best condition(test in lab)
* However, by Wolfram search engine, we can get historical data in few seconds.
* I guess the reason is data source selection. So we can try to change the data source of Financial data function in mma.
